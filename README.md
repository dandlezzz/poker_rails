Texas Hold-em on Rails
=======================
Novice programmer learning experience, trying to create from scratch a texas-hold em no limit single table tournament style poker game. 

Can currently start a new game with 9 players, chips, blinds, a pot, etc.  Can deal hole cards and community cards and combine them into final hands, and evaluate hand-types. 

All of the above can be displayed to the page.  

Tasks yet to do: 

Action, bet/call/raise/fold, allow computer to play by giving them a brain, allow users to sign in and take a spot at the table to play (hiding and showing cards at the right times...) Database logs of action history; success/fail rates, etc.  Avatars, better design, ajaxing most updates rather than rails redirects.
